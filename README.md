# Dwarf Dungeons

Game concept:
- STS/Darkest Dungeon type of game
- Multiple classes
- Weapons with buy/sell value
- 10 abilities per class (get 1x Basic attack + 3x abilities for the game loop) - potentially 20+ for versatility
- Beginning of game: 3 random abilities
- Find abilities during game play to swap out for current ones

Merchant options:
- Abilites
- HP refill
- Mana +1
- Weapon damage

Store options:
- Sell inventory gear
- Buy iron axe

Shit to make:
- Add store*
- Make an inventory system*
- Add story
- Add STS game (all enemies, extended stages)
- Add more abilities
- Make backgrounds & enemies
- Slot machine - spin button makes animation start, pressing it again makes it stop and show the result

maybe uh make it so that you build a deck of 5 cards? add more abilities, maybe define base prices for each ability?
