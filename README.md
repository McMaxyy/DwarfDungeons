# Dwarf Dungeons

Game concept:
- STS/Darkest Dungeon type of game
- Multiple classes (maybe eventually I guess)
- Weapons & items with buy/sell value
- 20 abilities per class (get 1x Basic attack + 4x abilities for the game loop)
- Beginning of game: 4 random abilities (low tier)
- Find abilities during game play to swap out for current ones

So I should write a story for my game but I can just have ChatGPT do that for me whenever I write down a concept lmao
